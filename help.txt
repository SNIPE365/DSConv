DSConv - C Data Structure Converter
Usage: DSConv.exe [flags] [-p [file.txt]] target[:filter] [target[:filter] ...]

TARGETS:
  A target can be a filename or a raw C-style string.
  Strings must be wrapped in double quotes (" ").

  file.c            Processes all structures found in the file.
  "int x[2]={0};"   Processes the provided code string.

FILTERS:
  Filters are appended to targets to select specific data structures.

  :index            Selects the Nth structure in that source (1-based).
                    Example: data.c:2 (Gets the second struct in the file).
  ::identifier      Selects a structure by its variable name.
                    Example: "int x[1]={1};"::x

FLAGS:
  -p [file.txt]     Print-to-file. Logs console output to a file.
                    If no filename is provided for a file target, it
                    defaults to file.txt.
                    Example: DSConv.exe main.c -p (Creates main.txt)

  -s                Silent Mode. Suppresses all console output.
                    Best used with -p to generate logs in the background.

COMBINATIONS & EXAMPLES:

  1. Multiple Files (Whole):
     DSConv.exe file1.c file2.c

  2. Mixed File and String with Index:
     DSConv.exe source.c:1 "int x[3]={1,2,3};":1

  3. Identifier Selection with Logging:
     DSConv.exe data.c::PlayerStats -p results.txt

  4. Silent Auto-Logging:
     DSConv.exe script.c -s -p
     (Writes data from script.c to script.txt with no console output)

  5. Complex Multi-Source:
     DSConv.exe fileA.c:2 "int x[2]={1,2}; int y[2]={3,4};"::y fileB.c

NOTES:
  * Semicolons (;) are required at the end of every C structure.
  * Logic detects strings vs files by looking for '{', '[', or ';'.
  * All leading zeros in integers are preserved in output and logs.
