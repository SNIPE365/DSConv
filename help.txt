DSConv - C Data Structure Converter
Usage: DSConv.exe [options] <input_file>
       DSConv.exe -i "structure" [options]

OPTIONS:
  -i "code"   Interactive Mode. Parses C-style structures directly from
              the command line string. Wrap in " " for multiple structures.
              Example: -i "int x[2]={1,2}; int y[2]={3,4};"

  -o <file>   Output Logging. Appends all results to the specified text file
              while still displaying them to the console.
              Example: -o logs.txt

  -s          Silent Mode. Suppresses console/file output. Useful for
              verifying syntax without generating logs.

EXAMPLES:
  1. Inspect a file:
     DSConv.exe data.c

  2. Interactive mode with logging:
     DSConv.exe -i "int values[3] = {001, 02, 3};" -o results.txt

  3. Multiple structures in one go:
     DSConv.exe -i "int a[1]={5}; int b[1]={10};"

NOTES:
  * Semicolons (;) are required after every structure declaration.
  * Leading zeros (padding) in integers are preserved in the output.
  * Uninitialized elements are marked as {uninit}.
