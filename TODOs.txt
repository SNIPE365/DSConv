- allow more data types , including ones that contain spaces such as long long, and static unsigned long long int
- make the real interactive mode flag (-ii) which lets the user type multi line C code without needing to only input data structures and use "" for more than one.
- make it actually convert arrays to structs
- make it work with multi line formatted data structures as well as the \ operator rather than code packed onto a single line.
- make the input data structures also support structs, and output arrays, so far the utility only prints information about the data stucture
- make the tool have formatting options for different C coding styles
- maybe allow inputting and outputting unions, by faking a union somehow.
- allow more complex declarations and initializations like multi directional arrays
- allow even more crazy  declarations and initializations like anonymous arrays, and address literals, compound literals, designated initializers , .. operator, 
  address literals, and GNU statement expressions.
- allow switches to convert the Nth input data structure into a specified data structure. 
- also allow selecting certain data structures but not numerically, but by inputting the data structure name.
- test other architectures to ensure that the right arch name is being printed, but also test to make sure the short long and long long modifiers are printing the
  correct sizes and ranges respective of architectre.
